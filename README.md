This tool determines whether a [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) software bill of
materials (SBOM) document contains informational items as required by a
certain specification.

## Conformance

Currently, the supported specifications are:

- 2021 National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
  ["minimum elements."][ntia]
- 2024 CISA Framing Software Component Transparency (FSCT3)
  ["minimum expected."][fsct3]

The minimum elements include:

- Supplier Name
- Component Name
- Version of the Component
- Other Unique Identifiers
- Dependency Relationship
- Author of SBOM Data
- Timestamp

As defined by the NTIA, the minimum elements are
"the essential pieces that support basic SBOM functionality and will serve as
the foundation for an evolving approach to software transparency."

In addition to information similar to NTIA minimum elements,
FSCT3 requires these Baseline Attributes as part of its "minimum expected":

- License
- Copyright Holder (inside Copyright Notice)

Mappings:

- The mapping of the NTIA elements required data fields to the SPDX 2.3
  specification can be found [here][ntia-spdx23].
- The mapping of FSCT3 Baseline Attributes to ISO/IEC 5962:2021 (SPDX 2.2.1)
  and SPDX 3.0 can be found at Section 2.5 of the FSCT3 document.
- More comparison of SBOM requirements and their mapping to SPDX can be found
  in [this slide][sbom-reqs] from Takashi Ninjouji of OpenChain Japan SBOM
  Sub-WG, presented at SPDX General Meeting 2024-12-05.

## Installation

This tool requires Python 3.9+.
Its dependencies may require a more recent version of Python.

*Installation Method #1*:
Install from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)][pypi] with `pip`.

```bash
pip install ntia-conformance-checker
```

*Installation Method #2*: Install from local source.
Clone the repo and install dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spdx/ntia-conformance-checker.git
cd ntia-conformance-checker
pip install .
```

It is recommended to use a virtual environment, especially
if you work with multiple Python versions.
`virtualenv` is a tool for creating isolated Python environments;
it lets you keep a project's dependencies in a single environment
or create separate environments for testing with different Python versions.

## CLI Usage

```text
usage: sbomcheck [OPTIONS] FILE

  FILE                  Filepath for SBOM input

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --sbom-spec {spdx2,spdx3}
                        SBOM specification of the input file; see below for details [default: spdx2]
  -c, --comply {fsct3-min,ntia}
                        Compliance standards to check against; see below for details [default: ntia]
  --skip-validation     Skip validation
  -r, --output {html,json,print,quiet}
                        Type of compliance report output; see below for details [default: print]
  -o, --output-file PATH
                        Filepath for compliance report output; if omitted, prints to console
  -v, --verbose         Print more information (debug)
  -V, --version         Display version of sbomcheck

choices:
  SBOM specifications (for --sbom-spec):
    spdx2       Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) 2.x
    spdx3       System Package Data Exchange (SPDX) 3.x

  Compliance standards (for --comply):
    fsct3-min   2024 CISA Framing Software Component Transparency (minimum expectation)
    ntia        2021 NTIA SBOM Minimum Elements

  Report output types (for --output):
    html        Report in HTML format
    json        Report in JSON format
    print       Print report to console
    quiet       No output unless there are errors

Examples:
  sbomcheck sbom.spdx
  sbomcheck -s spdx3 -c fsct3-min -v sbom.json
  sbomcheck sbom.yaml --output json --output-file report.json
```

The user can then analyze a particular file:

```bash
sbomcheck sbom.json
```

To generate the output in machine-readable JSON, run:

```bash
sbomcheck sbom.spdx --output json
```

To analyze an SPDX 3 JSON file, run:

```bash
sbomcheck sbom.spdx --sbom-spec spdx3
```

Use `-h` for help:

```bash
sbomcheck -h
```

## Usage as a Library

`ntia-conformance-checker` can also be imported as a library. For example:

```python
from ntia_conformance_checker import SbomChecker

sbom_checker = SbomChecker("SBOM_filepath")

print(sbom_checker.compliant)
```

See the API documentation at:
<https://spdx.github.io/ntia-conformance-checker/>

Additional properties and methods can be found in `BaseChecker` class
at [`base_checker.py`](ntia_conformance_checker/base_checker.py).
Specific properties and methods for a particular specification can be found
at the checker for that specification. For example, `NTIAChecker` class
at [`ntia_checker.py`](ntia_conformance_checker/ntia_checker.py).

## Online Usage

With the SPDX Online Tool, you can check the SBOM conformance without the need
to install the Python package.
