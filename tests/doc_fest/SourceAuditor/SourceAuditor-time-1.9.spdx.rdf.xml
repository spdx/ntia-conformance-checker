                    <spdx:licenseText>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

      &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Preamble
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft
      license for software and other kinds of works.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
      take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU
      General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
      change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software
      for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General
      Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work
      released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
      price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
      have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
      for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
      if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
      it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
      these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
      certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or
      if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
      or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
      you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
      source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
      (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
      giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly
      explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For
      both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified
      versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will
      not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
      versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can
      do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
      users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of
      such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,
      which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have
      designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
      products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,
      we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
      versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
      States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
      software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
      to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
      could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL
      assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The precise terms and conditions for copying,
      distribution and modification follow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply
          to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
          this License. Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Licensees&amp;quot;
          and &amp;quot;recipients&amp;quot; may be individuals or organizations.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          To &amp;quot;modify&amp;quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
          work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
          making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &amp;quot;modified
          version&amp;quot; of the earlier work or a work &amp;quot;based on&amp;quot; the earlier work.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;covered work&amp;quot; means either the unmodified
          Program or a work based on the Program.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          To &amp;quot;propagate&amp;quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
          permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
          infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
          on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
          copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available
          to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation
          that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
          Mere interaction with a user through a computer
          network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot;
          to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
          feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
          tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
          the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
          the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
          If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
          such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;1.&lt;/var&gt;
        Source Code.&lt;br /&gt;

        The &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; for a work means the preferred
        form of the work for making modifications to it.
        &amp;quot;Object code&amp;quot; means any non-source form of a work.
        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Standard Interface&amp;quot; means an interface that either is an official
          standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case
          of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,
          one that is widely used among developers working in that language.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other
          than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form
          of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
          Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
          Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
          implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
          &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
          (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
          (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
          produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all
          the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
          work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
          to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&amp;apos;s
          System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available
          free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities
          but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
          Source includes interface definition files associated with source
          files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries
          and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
          designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or
          control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
          regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The Corresponding Source for a work
          in source code form is that same work.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;2.&lt;/var&gt;
        Basic Permissions.&lt;br /&gt;

        All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
        copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
        conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
        permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
        covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
        content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
        rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
          without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
          You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
          them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
          facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
          the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
          not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
          for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
          and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies
          of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
          solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing
          is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.&lt;/var&gt;
        Protecting Users&amp;apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&lt;br /&gt;

        No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
        measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
        11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
        similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
        &lt;p&gt;
          When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to
          forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent
          such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this
          License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
          intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means
          of enforcing, against the work&amp;apos;s users, your or third parties&amp;apos;
          legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;4.&lt;/var&gt;
        Conveying Verbatim Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s source code as
        you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
        and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
        notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
        non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
        code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
        give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you
          convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.&lt;/var&gt;
        Conveying Modified Source Versions.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
        produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
        of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;a)&lt;/var&gt;
            The work must carry prominent notices stating
            that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;b)&lt;/var&gt;
            The work must carry prominent notices stating that
            it is released under this License and any conditions
            added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
            requirement in section 4 to &amp;quot;keep intact all notices&amp;quot;.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;c)&lt;/var&gt;
            You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
            to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License
            will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
            additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
            regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
            permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
            invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;d)&lt;/var&gt;
            If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
            display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program
            has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate
            Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
          works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
          work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
          program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
          is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot; if the compilation and its resulting
          copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
          of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what the individual works
          permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
          cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.&lt;/var&gt;
        Conveying Non-Source Forms.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey a covered work in object code form
        under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you
        also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
        under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical
            product (including a physical distribution medium),
            accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable
            physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
            written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
            as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
            product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
            either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software
            in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable
            physical medium customarily used for software interchange,
            for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
            performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy
            the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;c)&lt;/var&gt;
            Convey individual copies of the object code with a
            copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding
            Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally
            and noncommercially, and only if you received the object
            code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;d)&lt;/var&gt;
            Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
            (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
            Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
            no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
            Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place
            to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
            Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
            party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
            maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where
            to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts
            the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it
            is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;e)&lt;/var&gt;
            Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
            provided you inform other peers where the object code
            and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered
            to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
          excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,
          need not be included in conveying the object code work.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;User Product&amp;quot; is either (1) a &amp;quot;consumer product&amp;quot;, which means
          any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
          family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold
          for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product
          is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor
          of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
          user, &amp;quot;normally used&amp;quot; refers to a typical or common use of that
          class of product, regardless of the status of the particular
          user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
          or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a
          consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
          commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
          represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,
          procedures, authorization keys, or other information required
          to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in
          that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
          Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
          functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented
          or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
          or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
          occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
          and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
          perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
          is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
          section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.
          But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third
          party retains the ability to install modified object code on the
          User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
          include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
          warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified
          or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in
          which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network
          may be denied when the modification itself materially and
          adversely affects the operation of the network or violates
          the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
          provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that
          is publicly documented (and with an implementation available
          to the public in source code form), and must require no
          special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;7.&lt;/var&gt;
        Additional Terms.&lt;br /&gt;

        &amp;quot;Additional permissions&amp;quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
        License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
        Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
        shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to
        the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional
        permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used
        separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
        governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
        &lt;p&gt;
          When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
          remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
          of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
          removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
          additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
          for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
          add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
          of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently
            from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal
            notices or author attributions in that material or in the
            Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;c)&lt;/var&gt;
            Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
            or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
            in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;d)&lt;/var&gt;
            Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names
            of licensors or authors of the material; or
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;e)&lt;/var&gt;
            Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use
            of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;f)&lt;/var&gt;
            Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
            material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
            versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability
            to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
            assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further
          restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program
          as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating
          that it is governed by this License along with a term that is
          a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
          document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
          conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material
          governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the
          further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
          section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a
          statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,
          or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
          stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated
          as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.&lt;/var&gt;
        Termination.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as
        expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
        to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically
        terminate your rights under this License (including any patent
        licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
        &lt;p&gt;
          However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
          license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
          provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
          and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if
          the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
          some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
          reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you
          of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first
          time you have received notice of violation of this License
          (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
          violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Termination of your rights under this section does not
          terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or
          rights from you under this License. If your rights have been
          terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify
          to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.&lt;/var&gt;
        Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

        You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
        run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
        occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
        to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
        nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate
        or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you
        do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
        covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;10.&lt;/var&gt;
        Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;

        Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
        receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
        propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
        for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
        &lt;p&gt;
          An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of
          an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing
          an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a
          covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
          transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
          licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could
          give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
          Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,
          if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
          rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you
          may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
          of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
          litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
          alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,
          offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;11.&lt;/var&gt;
        Patents.&lt;br /&gt;

        A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
        License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
        work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.
        &lt;p&gt;
          A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent
          claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already
          acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
          manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling
          its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
          be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
          of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
          &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in
          a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
          patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,
          to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
          modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any
          express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
          enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice
          a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To
          &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an
          agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
          and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
          to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
          a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
          means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to
          be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
          of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in
          a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend
          the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;
          means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your
          conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of
          the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
          patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
          arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance
          of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the
          parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
          propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
          then the patent license you grant is automatically extended
          to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the
          scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned
          on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
          granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if
          you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
          business of distributing software, under which you make payment to
          the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
          the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
          parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
          patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
          conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
          for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
          contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
          or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or
          limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement
          that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;12.&lt;/var&gt;
        No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;

        If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
        or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
        they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If
        you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously
        your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
        obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.
        For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect
        a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
        Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
        License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;13.&lt;/var&gt;
        Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
        permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
        under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into
        a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The
        terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which
        is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU
        Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
        through a network will apply to the combination as such.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;14.&lt;/var&gt;
        Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;

        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such
        new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
          Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
          General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,
          you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
          of that numbered version or of any later version published by
          the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
          version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
          any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
          versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
          proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
          authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Later license versions may give you additional or
          different permissions. However, no additional obligations
          are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a
          result of your choosing to follow a later version.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;15.&lt;/var&gt;
        Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;

        THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
        APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT
        WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
        LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
        A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
        OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
        ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;16.&lt;/var&gt;
        Limitation of Liability.&lt;br /&gt;

        IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
        CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
        INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
        ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
        BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
        OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
        PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
        OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;17.&lt;/var&gt;
        Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
    &lt;p&gt;
      If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability
      provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to
      their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most
      closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
      connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
      liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class="optional-license-text"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
        of the greatest possible use to the public, the best
        way to achieve this is to make it free software which
        everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;&amp;lt;one line to give the program&amp;apos;s name and
        a brief idea of what it does.&amp;gt;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Copyright (C) &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;&amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;&lt;/var&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
        as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version
        3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
        useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
        warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a
        short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;

        it under certain conditions; type `show c&amp;apos; for details.

      &lt;p&gt;
        The hypothetical commands `show w&amp;apos; and `show c&amp;apos; should
        show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
        Of course, your program&amp;apos;s commands might be different;
        for a GUI interface, you would use an &amp;quot;about box&amp;quot;.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        You should also get your employer (if you work as a
        programmer) or school, if any, to sign a &amp;quot;copyright disclaimer&amp;quot;
        for the program, if necessary. For more information on
	this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see

      &lt;p&gt;
        The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating
        your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a
        subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
        linking proprietary applications with the library. If this
        is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
	License instead of this License. But first, please read

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="0.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="d)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="d)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="e)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="d)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="e)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="f)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Patents.

   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="14.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="15.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="16.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="17.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

&lt;&lt;var;name="description";original="&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;";match=".+"&gt;&gt;

Copyright (C) &lt;&lt;var;name="copyright";original="&lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;";match=".+"&gt;&gt;

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

&lt;program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

    &lt;p&gt;
      Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      USA
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Preamble
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
      to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
      intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
      make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
      License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation&amp;apos;s software
      and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other
      Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General
      Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
      the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
      this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get
      it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
      it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
      rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
      you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
      or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
      have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
      code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
      software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
      permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Also, for each author&amp;apos;s protection and ours, we want to make
      certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
      this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
      and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
      have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
      others will not reflect on the original authors&amp;apos; reputations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
      We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program
      will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
      proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
      must be licensed for everyone&amp;apos;s free use or not licensed at all.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The precise terms and conditions for copying,
      distribution and modification follow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;&lt;/var&gt;
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;0.&lt;/var&gt;
        This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
        notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
        under the terms of this General Public License. The &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;, below,
        refers to any such program or work, and a &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot;
        means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
        that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
        either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
        language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
        in the term &amp;quot;modification&amp;quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.
        &lt;p&gt;
          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
          not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act
          of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
          Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
          on the Program (independent of having been made by running the
          Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;1.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s source
        code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
        and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
        and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
        this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
        recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may charge a fee for the physical act of
          transferring a copy, and you may at your option
          offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;2.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
        of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
        distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
        1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;a)&lt;/var&gt;
            You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;b)&lt;/var&gt;
            You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
            that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
            Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
            charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;c)&lt;/var&gt;
            If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
            when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
            interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
            an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
            a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
            provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
            under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
            of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
            but does not normally print such an announcement, your work
            based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
          identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
          Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
          works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
          apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
          works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
          whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution
          of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
          permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
          and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
          contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
          the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution
          of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
          the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the
          Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does
          not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
        under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
        Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
            code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and
            2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
            years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
            cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
            machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to
            be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
            on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;c)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
            to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative
            is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if
            you received the program in object code or executable form
            with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
          for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
          source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
          plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
          used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
          However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
          need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
          source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
          kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
          runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
          access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
          access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
          distribution of the source code, even though third parties are
          not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;4.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
        except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
        otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
        is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
        this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
        rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
        terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.&lt;/var&gt;
        You are not required to accept this License, since you have
        not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
        modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
        actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
        Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
        work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
        License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
        distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.&lt;/var&gt;
        Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
        these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
        on the recipients&amp;apos; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
        responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;7.&lt;/var&gt;
        If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
        conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
        or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
        they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
        cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
        under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
        consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,
        if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
        the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
        through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
        License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
        &lt;p&gt;
          If any portion of this section is held invalid or
          unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
          balance of the section is intended to apply and the section
          as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
          any patents or other property right claims or to contest
          validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
          of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
          system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
          people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
          software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
          application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
          decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through
          any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
          believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.&lt;/var&gt;
        If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
        certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
        the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
        License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
        excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
        in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
        incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.&lt;/var&gt;
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
        new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
          Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
          to it and &amp;quot;any later version&amp;quot;, you have the option of following
          the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
          version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
          does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
          any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;10.&lt;/var&gt;
        If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
        author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
        Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
        sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
        two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
        software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
        &lt;p&gt;
          NO WARRANTY
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;11.&lt;/var&gt;
        BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
        FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
        WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
        PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
        EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
        IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
        THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
        ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;12.&lt;/var&gt;
        IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
        REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
        DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
        DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
        (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
        INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
        THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
        OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class="optional-license-text"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
        of the greatest possible use to the public, the best
        way to achieve this is to make it free software which
        everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;&amp;lt;one line to give the program&amp;apos;s name and an idea of what it does.&amp;gt;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Copyright (C) &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;&amp;lt;yyyy&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;&lt;/var&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
        as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version
        2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
        useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) yyyy name of author

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

&lt;&lt;var;name="description";original="&lt;one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.&gt;";match=".+"&gt;&gt;

Copyright (C) &lt;&lt;var;name="copyright";original="&lt;yyyy&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;";match=".+"&gt;&gt;

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;signature of Ty Coon&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice

&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

The GNU General Public License (GPL) does govern all other use of the material that constitutes the Autoconf program.

Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied (in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of Autoconf. We call these the "data" portions. The rest of the Autoconf source text consists of comments plus executable code that decides which of the data portions to output in any given case. We call these comments and executable code the "non-data" portions. Autoconf never copies any of the non-data portions into its output.

This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf released by the Free Software Foundation.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
     K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
     O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

 Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

 with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

      &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;0.&lt;/var&gt;
        PREAMBLE
        &lt;p&gt;
          The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
          other functional and useful document &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; in the sense of
          freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
          redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially
          or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
          author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while
          not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          This License is a kind of &amp;quot;copyleft&amp;quot;, which means that
          derivative works of the document must themselves be free in
          the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,
          which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
          free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
          program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
          software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
          it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
          whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
          principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;1.&lt;/var&gt;
        APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
        &lt;p&gt;
          This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
          that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
          it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a
          notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
          duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.
          The &amp;quot;Document&amp;quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work.
          Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
          &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute
          the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Modified Version&amp;quot; of the Document means any work containing
          the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or
          with modifications and/or translated into another language.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Secondary Section&amp;quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter
          section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
          relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
          Document&amp;apos;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
          nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
          (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
          a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The
          relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
          the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
          philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Invariant Sections&amp;quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose
          titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
          in the notice that says that the Document is released under
          this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of
          Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
          The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
          does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Cover Texts&amp;quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
          as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
          the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
          be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Transparent&amp;quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable
          copy, represented in a format whose specification is available
          to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
          straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
          pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
          drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
          for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
          to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
          format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
          or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
          An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial
          amount of text. A copy that is not &amp;quot;Transparent&amp;quot; is called &amp;quot;Opaque&amp;quot;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
          ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
          SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
          simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
          Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
          Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read
          and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML
          for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
          available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
          produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Title Page&amp;quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
          plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
          material this License requires to appear in the title page. For
          works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &amp;quot;Title
          Page&amp;quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
          work&amp;apos;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;publisher&amp;quot; means any person or entity that
          distributes copies of the Document to the public.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose
          title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
          text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for
          a specific section name mentioned below, such as &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;,
          &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;.) To &amp;quot;Preserve the
          Title&amp;quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that
          it remains a section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; according to this definition.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
          which states that this License applies to the Document. These
          Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
          in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:
          any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may
          have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;2.&lt;/var&gt;
        VERBATIM COPYING
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
          commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
          copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
          to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
          other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not
          use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
          copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
          compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
          number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may also lend copies, under the same conditions
          stated above, and you may publicly display copies.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.&lt;/var&gt;
        COPYING IN QUANTITY
        &lt;p&gt;
          If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
          have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
          and the Document&amp;apos;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
          enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
          all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
          Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly
          and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The
          front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
          equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the
          covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
          long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
          conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the required texts for either cover are too
          voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first
          ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
          cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
          numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
          Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
          each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
          network-using public has access to download using public-standard
          network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,
          free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take
          reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
          copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
          remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
          year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
          or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          It is requested, but not required, that you contact
          the authors of the Document well before redistributing
          any large number of copies, to give them a chance to
          provide you with an updated version of the Document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;4.&lt;/var&gt;
        MODIFICATIONS
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
          the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
          the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
          Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
          and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
          of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;A.&lt;/var&gt;
            Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
            from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
            (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
            of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
            if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;B.&lt;/var&gt;
            List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
            entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
            Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
            authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
            fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;C.&lt;/var&gt;
            State on the Title page the name of the publisher
            of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;D.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;E.&lt;/var&gt;
            Add an appropriate copyright notice for your
            modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;F.&lt;/var&gt;
            Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
            giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
            terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;G.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
            Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&amp;apos;s
            license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;I.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve the section Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;, Preserve its Title, and
            add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
            and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
            Page. If there is no section Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot; in the Document,
            create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher
            of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
            describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;J.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
            for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
            likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
            versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;
            section. You may omit a network location for a work that was
            published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the
            original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;K.&lt;/var&gt;
            For any section Entitled &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;,
            Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
            section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
            acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;L.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
            in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
            equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;M.&lt;/var&gt;
            Delete any section Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;. Such a
            section may not be included in the Modified Version.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;N.&lt;/var&gt;
            Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;
            or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;O.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
          appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
          copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or
          all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles
          to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&amp;apos;s license
          notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may add a section Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;, provided
          it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified
          Version by various parties--for example, statements of
          peer review or that the text has been approved by an
          organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
          and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
          the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage
          of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
          through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
          includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
          by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
          you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
          permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
          License give permission to use their names for publicity for
          or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.&lt;/var&gt;
        COMBINING DOCUMENTS
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may combine the Document with other documents released under
          this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
          versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
          Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified,
          and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
          license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
          multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
          copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
          but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
          by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
          author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique
          number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list
          of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
          &amp;quot;History&amp;quot; in the various original documents, forming one section
          Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled
          &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, and any sections Entitled &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;.
          You must delete all sections Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.&lt;/var&gt;
        COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
          other documents released under this License, and replace the
          individual copies of this License in the various documents
          with a single copy that is included in the collection,
          provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
          copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may extract a single document from such a collection,
          and distribute it individually under this License,
          provided you insert a copy of this License into the
          extracted document, and follow this License in all other
          respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;7.&lt;/var&gt;
        AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
        &lt;p&gt;
          A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
          separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume
          of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot;
          if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to
          limit the legal rights of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what
          the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an
          aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
          aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
          these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less
          than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&amp;apos;s Cover
          Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document
          within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers
          if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must
          appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.&lt;/var&gt;
        TRANSLATION
        &lt;p&gt;
          Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
          distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
          4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
          permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
          translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
          original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
          translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
          Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
          include the original English version of this License and the original
          versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement
          between the translation and the original version of this License
          or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If a section in the Document is Entitled
          &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;, the
          requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section
          1) will typically require changing the actual title.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.&lt;/var&gt;
        TERMINATION
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
          except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
          otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
          and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
          license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
          provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
          and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if
          the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
          some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
          reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you
          of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first
          time you have received notice of violation of this License
          (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
          violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
          the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
          you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and
          not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all
          of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;10.&lt;/var&gt;
        FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
        &lt;p&gt;
          The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
          versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time
          to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to
          the present version, but may differ in detail to address
          new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
          If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
          License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it, you have the option of
          following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
          of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
          Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
          number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
          as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies
          that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can
          be used, that proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version
          permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;11.&lt;/var&gt;
        RELICENSING
        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;MMC Site&amp;quot;) means any
          World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
          provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A
          public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A
          &amp;quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;MMC&amp;quot;) contained in the site
          means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;quot;CC-BY-SA&amp;quot; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike
          3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a
          not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business
          in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft
          versions of that license published by that same organization.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;quot;Incorporate&amp;quot; means to publish or republish a Document,
          in whole or in part, as part of another Document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          An MMC is &amp;quot;eligible for relicensing&amp;quot; if it is licensed under this
          License, and if all works that were first published under this License
          somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in
          whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant
          sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in
          the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before
          August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class="optional-license-text"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To use this License in a document you have written, include
        a copy of the License in the document and put the following
        copyright and license notices just after the title page:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
        distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
        Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published
        by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections,
        no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is
        included in the section entitled &amp;quot;GNU Free Documentation License&amp;quot;.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and
        Back-Cover Texts, replace the &amp;quot;with...Texts.&amp;quot; line with this:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts,
        or some other combination of the three, merge
        those two alternatives to suit the situation.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
        code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel
        under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU
        General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
      &lt;/p&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="0.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

   The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.

   A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="A.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="B.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="C.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="D.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="E.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="F.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="G.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="I.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="J.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="K.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="L.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="M.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="N.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="O.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

   If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; RELICENSING

   "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

   "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.

   "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.

   An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

   The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

         &lt;p&gt;CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS
         DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION
         ON AN &amp;quot;AS-IS&amp;quot; BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT
         OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE

      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Statement of Purpose&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related
         Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &amp;quot;owner&amp;quot;)
         of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a
         commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (&amp;quot;Commons&amp;quot;) that the public can reliably
         and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
         and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without
         limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a
         free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
         reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration
         or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the &amp;quot;Affirmer&amp;quot;), to the extent that
         he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to
         the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
         Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;1.&lt;/var&gt;
          Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and
             related or neighboring rights (&amp;quot;Copyright and Related Rights&amp;quot;). Copyright and
             Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
          
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;i.&lt;/var&gt;
              the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;ii.&lt;/var&gt;
              moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;iii.&lt;/var&gt;
              publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&amp;apos;s image or likeness depicted in a Work;
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;iv.&lt;/var&gt;
              rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations
                 in paragraph 4(a), below;
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;v.&lt;/var&gt;
              rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;vi.&lt;/var&gt;
              database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and
                 of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any
                 national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
                 directive); and
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;vii.&lt;/var&gt;
              other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable
                 law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
             Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,
             and surrenders all of Affirmer&amp;apos;s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and
             causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims
             and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
             duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any
             current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
             including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
             &amp;quot;Waiver&amp;quot;). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at
             large and to the detriment of Affirmer&amp;apos;s heirs and successors, fully intending that such
             Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other
             legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as
             contemplated by Affirmer&amp;apos;s express Statement of Purpose.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid
             or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent
             permitted taking into account Affirmer&amp;apos;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to
             the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
             royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
             unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&amp;apos;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)
             in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
             treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any
             number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
             commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &amp;quot;License&amp;quot;). The License shall
             be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of
             the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
             partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and
             in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her
             remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and
             causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer&amp;apos;s express
             Statement of Purpose.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Limitations and Disclaimers.
          
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;a.&lt;/var&gt;
              No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed
                 or otherwise affected by this document.
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;b.&lt;/var&gt;
              Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
                 concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without
                 limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
                 infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
                 absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible
                 under applicable law.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="i.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="ii.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="iii.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="iv.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="v.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="vi.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="vii.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limitations and Disclaimers.

    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,

    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
